# Snapshots table is part of mksnp tools, but can be used for others.
# Only lines wich starts with '/' character will be procesed.

# First field is the source btrfs subvolume, the second one is the pool,
# a directory where snapshots will be stored.

# Third field is the frequency in which snapshots will be captured and stored.
# If this is 0, means that only once (on program start) will be checked.
# Append s, m, h, d or y to say seconds, minutes, hours, days or years. If no
# character is appened, then means seconds.

# And fourth field (quota) is how many snapshots will be stored in pool. When
# this number was reached, the olders snapshots will be deleted until total
# snapshots does not exceed quota number.
