.SH DESCRIPTION
Snapshots table (\f[CR]/etc/sstab\f[R]) is part of sskit, but its siple
format allow that can be used for other utilities.
.PP
When you run \f[CR]sskd\f[R] it will read this file and then it will
make backups (snapshots) of indicated subvolumes at desired frequency
until reach a defined quota.
I quota were reached, then it will remove the older backups to keep the
number of backups indicated in quota.
.PP
The configuration file is mandatory.
If there is not such file, the program will fail.
.SH FORMAT
Only lines beginning with `\f[CR]/\f[R]' character will be processed.
This means that any line that does not start with / will be ignored.
.PP
First field is the source btrfs \f[I]subvolume\f[R], the second one is
the \f[I]pool\f[R], a directory where snapshots will be stored.
.PP
Third field is the \f[I]frequency\f[R] in which snapshots will be
captured and stored.
If this is \f[I]0\f[R], means that only once (on program start) will be
checked.
Append s, m, h, d or y to say seconds, minutes, hours, days or years.
If no character is appened, then means seconds.
.PP
And fourth field, \f[I]quota\f[R], is how many snapshots will be stored
in pool.
When this number was reached, the olders snapshots will be deleted until
the total number of snapshots does not exceed the quota.
